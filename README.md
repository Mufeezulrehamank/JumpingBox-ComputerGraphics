# JumpingBox-ComputerGraphics
Computer graphics involves the designing of objects in different forms which are regular and irregular 
in shape. This project is on “JUMPING BOX” Computer Graphics using OpenGL Functions. It is a user 
interactive program where in the user can view the required display by making use of the input devices like 
Keyboard and Mouse. This project mainly consists of a box and a green cactus as obstacle. The Box is made 
to jump on the cactus, so that it looks like a Jumping Box. The box is moved forward and its movements are 
controlled using the keyboard. The jumping of the box can be controlled by the player by pressing the keys 
‘w’ or ‘W’ or the spacebar. Trees have been drawn on the side of the track in which the box is jumping. The 
weather keeps changing from morning to night and vice versa on particular period of time which is specified 
by the player. Each time the box jumps the single cactus the score gets increased by two hundred points. 
When the box colloids with the cactus the game is over.
